# City-Temperature-Prediction

City temperature prediction using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with Tensorflow. This is an example of how to use DNN with Tensorflow to predict time series.

The dataset used can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).
